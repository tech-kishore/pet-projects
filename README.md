### Improving skills in web development, programming, UI, automation and more...

**Tip:** _If you pick a complex project, then focus on building one feature at a time. Building an entire website or app all at once is difficult. Start by building a login page, or maybe the main landing page after the user logs in. If you try to take on the whole project at once then you will likely fail._

## Entertainment
> ### 1. A web scraper that posts top 10 blogs without human intervention
>
>**Description:**
>  It doesn’t have to be fancy or get a lot of views. This scraper could pull the data into a database and then select the most popular posts. 
>  From there it could copy the title, along with a few sentences, and then create a post that it shares online.
>
>**Scope:**
> - built a web scraper and scraped the data
> - build a website with that data
>
>**Skills:** Database, web scraper, automation, web development (for the blog), and general programming.
>
>**Objective:**
> You’ve now shown that you can do more than just code a small segment of a system.
> Instead, you can think through an entire system. You need to consider how you are going to automate the process, manage the database, create the website and select the posts. This also allows you to actually have a tangible end product.

> ### 2. An event-alert system using Meetup and Eventbrite APIs
> 
> **Description:**
> Have you ever wanted to go to a band or comedian show, but realized it was last week? Maybe there was a free conference in your area on data science or big data and you missed out because you forgot to check.
> Why not make your own aggregator using the Meetup and Eventbrite APIs, that will warn you when keywords are in event descriptions or titles?
> You can customize the system to work the way you want, and maybe even allow other people to make their own alerts by making this a website.
> 
>**Scope:**
> - make your own aggregator using the Meetup and Eventbrite APIs
>
>**Skills:** APIs, database, automation, web development, and general programming.
>
>**Objective:**
