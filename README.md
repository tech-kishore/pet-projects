# 10 Programming Pet Projects

### Improving skills in web development, programming, UI, automation and more...

**Tip:** _If you pick a complex project, then focus on building one feature at a time. Building an entire website or app all at once is difficult. Start by building a login page, or maybe the main landing page after the user logs in. If you try to take on the whole project at once then you will likely fail._

> ### 1. A web scraper that posts top 10 blogs without human intervention
>
>**Scope:**
> - built a web scraper and scraped the data
> - build a website with that data
>
>**Description:**
>  It doesn’t have to be fancy or get a lot of views. This scraper could pull the data into a database and then select the most popular posts. 
>  From there it could copy the title, along with a few sentences, and then create a post that it shares online. This would be an impressive and simple project that you can actually show off.
>
> You’ve now shown that you can do more than just code a small segment of a system.
> Instead, you can think through an entire system. You need to consider how you are going to automate the process, manage the database, create the website and select the posts. This also allows you to actually have a tangible end product.

>**Skills:** Database, web scraper, automation, web development (for the blog), and general programming.
